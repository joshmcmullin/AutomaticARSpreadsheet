# AutomaticARSpreadsheet
Python script with openpyxl that parses Excel timesheets and separates based on data for easier invoicing.

The program is written in Python. It takes an Excel timesheet for my wife's work and organizes the information into different categories. It also parses for unbillable entries, entries made by specific people, etc. This splits it into 6 different labeled worksheets to make it easier for invoicing. It then shows how many rows of actual data are in each sheets to compare with the original sheet. This ensures no data was lost.
